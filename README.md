# JavaScript-Calculator
A simple calculator created in HTML,CSS, and JavaScript.

This was created using a YouTube tutorial by **Web Dev Simplified** that can be found **[here](https://youtu.be/j59qQ7YWLxw)**.

I have added comprehencive notes to all of the documents for clarification of what everything does.
